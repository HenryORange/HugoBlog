Now that I'm all done with the project, I can take a step back and evaluate my journey.

Overall, it was a really fun experience.
The challenges of overcoming problems when they arose, the creative freedom of just doing whatever I want, and the opportunity to learn new and exciting things were my top three.
It wasn't all fun and games (and definitely more than a normal exam) but I'm glad I chose this course.
The discussions in class and the new outside of it really sold me on it.

So for anyone reading this and thinking about taking this class, let me say the following:
It'll probably be a lot of work.
There'll probably be times you think to yourself, "how will I manage?".
But I can tell you, in the end you'll be glad to have been along for the ride - at least I am.
