Testing my final project state was fun.
But it was even more fun watching my friends test it (and hoping they would still be my friends afterward).

## General Observations
So overall, I found that my experience with the system gave me a huge advantage over my friends, allowing me to complete the tasks way faster.
I also noticed, that the reset gesture with the thumbs down was sometimes triggered on accident when trying to switch between speeds.
That led to some frustration, but was pretty fun to observe from the outside.

After a short period I also noticed that it is way more fun when I'm able to see what my friends can see.
So I started streaming their view from then on.

As metrics to evaluate my work against, I chose the completion time, the score next to it, and the [Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire (VRSQ)](https://omb.report/icr/202012-0920-016/doc/107354700).
The VRSQ is specifically designed to allow for judgements on ones disorientation after VR experiences and I chose it, because my locomotion technique messes with your sense of your physical orientation.
